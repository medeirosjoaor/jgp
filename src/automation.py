I would probably store the series IDs of my interest in a list, and create a function that recieves that list as an argument and runs
every single month using the schedule library since it's when new data is available. Since the data seems to have only one shape, I would
also create a helper function that takes the data and returns it in the right format to be converted to a csv file.
